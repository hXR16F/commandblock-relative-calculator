# CMD Block Relative Calculator

A lightweight desktop application for calculating relative coordinates for Minecraft command blocks. Designed to assist with commands like `/setblock`, `/fill`, `/clone` by converting absolute coordinates into relative ones.

Built with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html).

# Features

- Calculate relative coordinates between command block and destination
- Smart coordinates extraction using RegEx
- Compute `/setblock` command relative coordinates
- Compute full `/fill` and `/clone` command relative coordinates from two source corners and a destination
- Copy results to clipboard with a single click
- Automatically save logs to preserve previous calculations
- Light & dark theme

# Installation

## Option 1: Download precompiled Windows version

For Windows users, a standalone .exe file is available â€” no Python installation required.

1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/hXR16F/commandblock-relative-calculator/releases).
2. Download the latest .exe version from the Assets section.
3. Run the file â€” no setup needed.

> [!NOTE]
> This program was compiled using [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) with the following parameters:
> ```bash
> python -m nuitka "commandblock-relative-calculator.py" --windows-icon-from-ico=icon.ico --onefile --enable-plugin=tk-inter --windows-console-mode=disable
> ```

## Option 2: Run from source (cross-platform)

Tested on Python 3.11.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hXR16F/commandblock-relative-calculator
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Launch the app:
```bash
